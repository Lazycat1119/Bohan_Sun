      #Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I am Bohan Sun (Â≠ôÂçöÊ∂µ), currently a 3th-year undergraduate student majoring in Automation at Harbin Engineering University (expected graduation in July 2026) and doing research at CASIA, supervised by Prof.Guoqi Li.

My research interests mainly focus on machine learning system now, especially on the new architecture for LLM (Eg.Mamba).I'm also curious about speech processing and robotics. I am always seeking for some interesting and valuable research.
